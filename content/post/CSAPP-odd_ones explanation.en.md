int odd_ones(unsigned x) {
  x ^= x >> 16;

**ChatGPT:**

The function `odd_ones` checks whether the number of `1` bits in the input integer `x` is odd or even. It does this by progressively reducing the number of bits that need to be checked using bitwise XOR operations.

### Explanation of the approach:

1. **XOR shift operations:**
    
    * `x ^= x >> 16;`: This shifts `x` by 16 bits to the right and XORs the result with `x`. This merges the upper 16 bits into the lower 16 bits.
    * `x ^= x >> 8;`: This further reduces the problem by merging the upper 8 bits into the lower 8 bits.
    * `x ^= x >> 4;`: The process continues with 4 bits.
    * `x ^= x >> 2;`: Then with 2 bits.
    * `x ^= x >> 1;`: Finally, the bits are reduced to just the least significant bit, which holds the result of whether the number of `1` bits in the original number was odd or even.
2. **Returning the result:**
    
    * `return x & 1;`: After the successive XOR operations, `x` will contain a `1` in the least significant bit if the number of `1` bits in the original number was odd, and a `0` if the count was even. Thus, we return `x & 1` to extract the least significant bit.

### Why this works:

* The XOR operation propagates the bit count, reducing the problem to progressively fewer bits.
* At the end of the process, all the bits except the least significant bit are "merged" to either `0` or `1` depending on whether the original number of `1` bits was odd or even.

### Efficiency:

* The function uses only 5 XOR operations and a single bitwise AND operation, which is within the 12 operation limit specified by the problem.

The function is efficient and meets the constraints perfectly.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

**You:**

explain the expression x ^= x >> 16 and then I can understand the rest

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure! Let's break down the expression `x ^= x >> 16`.

### 1. **The Right Shift (`x >> 16`)**:

The operation `x >> 16` shifts the bits of `x` to the right by 16 positions. This means that all the bits in the lower 16 positions are moved to the right by 16 places, and the 16 most significant bits (MSBs) become the least significant bits (LSBs) of the shifted value. The empty spaces on the left are filled with zeroes (assuming `x` is unsigned).

For example, if `x` is a 32-bit value:

```scss
x = 11010011001010110101101000111101  (32 bits)
x >> 16 = 00000000000000001101001100101011  (16 bits)
```

After the shift, the lower 16 bits of `x` are discarded, and the upper 16 bits become the lower 16 bits of `x >> 16`.

### 2. **The XOR Operation (`x ^= x >> 16`)**:

The `^` operator is the XOR (exclusive OR) operation. XOR works on corresponding bits of two operands and returns `1` if the bits are different, and `0` if the bits are the same.

The operation `x ^= x >> 16` means that the value of `x` will be updated by XORing its current value with the value of `x` after being shifted right by 16 bits.

Let's use an example for better understanding:

#### Example:

Let’s say `x = 0b11010011001010110101101000111101` (in binary).

1. **Step 1: Shift `x` by 16 bits:**
    
    * `x >> 16` shifts `x` by 16 bits, resulting in `x >> 16 = 0b00000000000000001101001100101011`.
2. **Step 2: XOR the original `x` with `x >> 16`:**
    
    ```markdown
    x = 0b11010011001010110101101000111101
    x >> 16 = 0b00000000000000001101001100101011
    -------------------------------------------
    x ^= x >> 16 -> 0b11010011001010110101101000111101
                    XOR
                    0b00000000000000001101001100101011
                    -------------------------------------------
                    Result: 0b11010011001010111000000100010110
    ```
    
    In the result, you can see that each bit of `x` is modified by XORing it with the corresponding bit of `x >> 16`. This combines information from the upper and lower 16 bits of `x`.
    

### **Why use `x ^= x >> 16`?**

The purpose of this XOR shift operation is to start combining bits from different parts of `x` so that we progressively reduce the bit count and ultimately determine whether the number of `1` bits in `x` is odd or even.

* After the first step (`x ^= x >> 16`), the 16 bits on the left of `x` (after the shift) are merged with the rightmost 16 bits of `x`.
* This helps reduce the problem by combining information about the bit count across larger chunks of `x`.

By the time we finish the process with `x ^= x >> 1`, all the bits in `x` have been merged into the least significant bit, which will hold the result: `1` if there is an odd number of `1` bits in the original `x`, and `0` if there is an even number of `1` bits.

* * *

I hope this makes it clearer! Feel free to ask more if you need additional details.

* * *

**You:**

give me the whole process of the XORs, as I'm still a little confused

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Let’s walk through the **entire process of XORs** in `odd_ones`, step by step, using a concrete example. We’ll use a 32-bit number and demonstrate how each XOR operation progressively reduces the number of bits.

### Example:

Suppose we start with:

```makefile
x = 0b1011_0110_1100_1111_1001_0101_1010_1101
```

This number contains **17 ones**, which is odd. By the end, we expect the function to return `1` (odd).

* * *

### Step 1: `x ^= x >> 16`

* `x >> 16` shifts the upper 16 bits to the lower 16 bits:
    
    ```
    x >> 16 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0000_1011_0110_1100_1111
    ```
    
* XOR `x` with `x >> 16`:
    
    ```diff
    x = 0b1011_0110_1100_1111_1001_0101_1010_1101
    x >> 16 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0000_1011_0110_1100_1111
    --------------------------------------------------
    x ^= x >> 16 = 0b1011_0110_1100_1111_0010_0011_0110_0010
    ```
    
* **Result after Step 1:**
    
    ```makefile
    x = 0b1011_0110_1100_1111_0010_0011_0110_0010
    ```
    

Now, the information from the upper 16 bits is combined into the lower 16 bits.

* * *

### Step 2: `x ^= x >> 8`

* `x >> 8` shifts the upper 8 bits to the lower 8 bits:
    
    ```
    x >> 8 = 0b0000_0000_1011_0110_1100_1111_0010_0011
    ```
    
* XOR `x` with `x >> 8`:
    
    ```diff
    x = 0b1011_0110_1100_1111_0010_0011_0110_0010
    x >> 8 = 0b0000_0000_1011_0110_1100_1111_0010_0011
    --------------------------------------------------
    x ^= x >> 8 = 0b1011_0110_0111_1001_1110_1100_0100_0001
    ```
    
* **Result after Step 2:**
    
    ```makefile
    x = 0b1011_0110_0111_1001_1110_1100_0100_0001
    ```
    

Now, the information from the upper 8 bits is combined into the lower 8 bits.

* * *

### Step 3: `x ^= x >> 4`

* `x >> 4` shifts the upper 4 bits to the lower 4 bits:
    
    ```
    x >> 4 = 0b0000_1011_0110_0111_1001_1110_1100_0100
    ```
    
* XOR `x` with `x >> 4`:
    
    ```diff
    x = 0b1011_0110_0111_1001_1110_1100_0100_0001
    x >> 4 = 0b0000_1011_0110_0111_1001_1110_1100_0100
    --------------------------------------------------
    x ^= x >> 4 = 0b1011_1101_0001_1110_0111_0010_1000_0101
    ```
    
* **Result after Step 3:**
    
    ```makefile
    x = 0b1011_1101_0001_1110_0111_0010_1000_0101
    ```
    

Now, the information from the upper 4 bits is combined into the lower 4 bits.

* * *

### Step 4: `x ^= x >> 2`

* `x >> 2` shifts the upper 2 bits to the lower 2 bits:
    
    ```
    x >> 2 = 0b0010_1111_0100_0011_1100_1111_0010_1000
    ```
    
* XOR `x` with `x >> 2`:
    
    ```diff
    x = 0b1011_1101_0001_1110_0111_0010_1000_0101
    x >> 2 = 0b0010_1111_0100_0011_1100_1111_0010_1000
    --------------------------------------------------
    x ^= x >> 2 = 0b1001_0010_0101_1101_1011_1101_1010_1101
    ```
    
* **Result after Step 4:**
    
    ```makefile
    x = 0b1001_0010_0101_1101_1011_1101_1010_1101
    ```
    

Now, the information from the upper 2 bits is combined into the lower 2 bits.

* * *

### Step 5: `x ^= x >> 1`

* `x >> 1` shifts the upper 1 bit to the lower 1 bit:
    
    ```
    x >> 1 = 0b0100_1001_0010_1110_1101_1110_1101_0110
    ```
    
* XOR `x` with `x >> 1`:
    
    ```diff
    x = 0b1001_0010_0101_1101_1011_1101_1010_1101
    x >> 1 = 0b0100_1001_0010_1110_1101_1110_1101_0110
    --------------------------------------------------
    x ^= x >> 1 = 0b1101_1011_0111_0011_0110_0011_0111_1011
    ```
    
* **Result after Step 5:**
    
    ```makefile
    x = 0b1101_1011_0111_0011_0110_0011_0111_1011
    ```
    

Now, the least significant bit contains the XOR result of all the bits in `x`.

* * *

### Final Step: `return x & 1`

* Extract the least significant bit:
    
    ```
    x & 1 = 0b1101_1011_0111_0011_0110_0011_0111_1011 & 0b1 = 1
    ```
    
* **Output:** The result is `1`, meaning the number of `1` bits in the original number is odd.
    

* * *

### Summary of Key Points:

* Each XOR operation combines more bits, reducing the total bits that need to be checked.
* After all the XOR operations, the least significant bit holds the parity (odd/even) of the number of `1` bits in the original number.
* The final `x & 1` extracts this parity as the return value.
