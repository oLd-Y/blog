I'm using the obsidian-latex-suite, what is the flags option in its snippets used for?
The whole document of snippets is as follows:


Copy
Snippets
Snippets are shortcuts that allow you to insert certain text based on certain triggers. For example, the default snippet

{trigger: "@l", replacement: "\\lambda", options: "mA"}
will expand "@l" to "\lambda".

Snippets can be edited in the plugin settings. The structure of a snippet is as follows:

{
  trigger: string | RegExp,
  replacement: string,
  options: string,
  priority?: number,
  description?: string,
  flags?: string,
}
trigger : The text that triggers this snippet.
Triggers can also be regular expressions. See here for more info.
replacement : The text to replace the trigger with.
Replacements can also be JavaScript functions. See here for more info.
options : See below.
priority (optional): This snippet's priority. Snippets with higher priority are run first. Can be negative. Defaults to 0.
description (optional): A description for this snippet.
flags (optional): Flags for regex snippets.

Based on the documentation shown, the flags option in obsidian-latex-suite snippets is specifically used when the trigger is a regular expression (RegExp). It allows you to specify regex flags that modify how the regular expression behaves.

Common regex flags include:

i for case-insensitive matching
g for global matching (find all matches rather than stopping after the first)
m for multiline mode
s for allowing dot (.) to match newlines
u for unicode support
For example, if you wanted to create a snippet that matches "@lambda" case-insensitively, you could write:

json

Copy
{
  trigger: /@lambda/,
  replacement: "\\lambda",
  options: "mA",
  flags: "i"
}
This way, both "@lambda", "@LAMBDA", and "@LaMbDa" would trigger the snippet.

The flags field is marked as optional in the documentation (flags?: string), so you only need to include it when you're using regex triggers and need to modify their behavior.
