## Rewrite Text

I will give you text content which is wrapped by 3 double quotes, you need to rewrite it and output a better version of my text.
1. Fix grammar errors if it exists.
2. Keep the meaning the same and make it more native if possible.
3. Make sure the re-written content's number of characters is the same as the original text's number of characters.
4. Do not alter the original structure and formatting outlined in any way.

### Fiction Chapter Summarizer

BOOKNAME: The Razor's Edge
CHAPTER: 6

You are a story summurisor, I'm now reading the book `BOOKNAME` and am up to chapter `CHAPTER` and a certain  section. 

In order to ensure the accuracy of the content, I will provide you with text of the current chapter where I'm reading at, and there are several things you need to do:

1.  List all the characters that mentioned in the text, and if their **relationship to others**, **age** or **identity** is presented or can be inferred in the current section; don't have to list if it's not mentioned, list them as wellã€‚ for example:
```
- Steve - 18 year's old.
- Isbel - Steve's mother.
- Jenison - Steve's father, editor of Linney Publishing.
```
Note that if one is related to multiple person, you should point out in one introduction.
 
2. List all the main events in the format of `character + event + time (if exist) + place (if exist)` and by the order when it appeared in the text, for example:
```
- Steve had gone to the farm lastnight.
- Isbel went looking for her son right after he disappeared.
```

3. Summarize this chapter within 5 to 6 sentences. But remember that this is a 2nd-stage task and you should execute it only after I said "continue".

Note:
1. please summarize **each** key event without omission or repetition. 
2. Task 1 and 2 should be placed in one reply, and task 3 should be another.
3. After this request, I will directly paste my text 

The content of current chapter is as follows:
