## **You:**

here is a statement in csapp (provided by the image). How could the number of bigger data type with leading 1 equals to the original number? explain it a bit.

## **ChatGPT:**

This statement refers to the _sign extension_ process in two's-complement representation, which ensures that the value of a number remains the same when its bit-width is expanded.

### Key Idea of Two's-Complement Sign Extension

In two's-complement notation, the **most significant bit (MSB)** is the **sign bit**:

* `0` indicates a non-negative number.
* `1` indicates a negative number.

When extending a two's-complement number to a larger bit-width, **the sign bit is replicated (copied)** into the additional higher-order bits. This preserves the number's original value because:

* For positive numbers (`MSB = 0`), adding leading `0`s does not change the magnitude.
* For negative numbers (`MSB = 1`), adding leading `1`s preserves the negative value by maintaining the two's-complement encoding.

### Why Does This Work?

The key is in how two's-complement numbers are interpreted:

$$B2T_w(\mathbf{x}) = -x_{w-1} \cdot 2^{w-1} + \sum_{i=0}^{w-2} x_i \cdot 2^i$$

Here:

* $x_{w-1}$ is the sign bit.
* $x_i$ are the other bits of the number.

When sign-extending to a new width $w' > w$, the replicated bits do not alter the value because:

* For positive numbers ($x_{w-1} = 0$), adding leading `0`s contributes nothing to the sum.
* For negative numbers ($x_{w-1} = 1$), adding leading `1`s adds a negative offset equivalent to what would be added if the value were represented at the original width $w$.

### Example: 4-bit to 8-bit

Letâ€™s see an example.

#### Case 1: Positive Number

Consider the 4-bit number $0110$ (6 in decimal). When expanded to 8 bits:

$$0110 \rightarrow 00000110$$

The value is unchanged, as the leading `0`s contribute nothing.

#### Case 2: Negative Number

Consider the 4-bit number $1010$ (-6 in decimal). When expanded to 8 bits:

$$1010 \rightarrow 11111010$$

The leading `1`s preserve the negative value in two's-complement, keeping it as -6.

This process guarantees that the number's value remains consistent regardless of its width.
