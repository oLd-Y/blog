# The Gift of the Magi

This story focuses on Jim and Della, a loving but impoverished couple in an apartment, who both sell their most valuable things in order to buy each other their most beloved gifts - Jim sells his prized pocket watch, and Della sells her long, proud hair. Yet the gifts they buy for each other require exactly these things as a foundation - Della buys a long chain for Jim's pocket watch for decoration, and Jim buys a comb for Della's hair. One is struck by the unexpectedness of the situation, but also by their true love.
