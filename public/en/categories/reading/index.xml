        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gift-of-the-magi&#34;&gt;The Gift of the Magi
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story focuses on Jim and Della, a loving but impoverished couple in an apartment, who both sell their most valuable things in order to buy each other their most beloved gifts - Jim sells his prized pocket watch, and Della sells her long, proud hair. Yet the gifts they buy for each other require exactly these things as a foundation - Della buys a long chain for Jim&amp;rsquo;s pocket watch for decoration, and Jim buys a comb for Della&amp;rsquo;s hair. One is struck by the unexpectedness of the situation, but also by their true love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-last-leaf&#34;&gt;The Last Leaf
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is mainly about a girl with Pneumonia, Johnsy, because the leaves of the vines outside of window are about to fall off, touched the feelings, and lost the confidentce in life, but did not expect that even after a night of wind and rain, the last leaf is still not blown off, thus regained the courage to live, after getting well, and found that the original leaf is downstairs, the painter who is also suffering from Pneumonia, Mr. Behrman, in order to encourage Johnsy to paint.&lt;/p&gt;
