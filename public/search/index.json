[{"content":"You:\nhere is a statement in csapp (provided by the image). How could the number of bigger data type with leading 1 equals to the original number? explain it a bit.\nChatGPT:\nThis statement refers to the sign extension process in two\u0026rsquo;s-complement representation, which ensures that the value of a number remains the same when its bit-width is expanded.\nKey Idea of Two\u0026rsquo;s-Complement Sign Extension In two\u0026rsquo;s-complement notation, the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit:\n0 indicates a non-negative number. 1 indicates a negative number. When extending a two\u0026rsquo;s-complement number to a larger bit-width, the sign bit is replicated (copied) into the additional higher-order bits. This preserves the number\u0026rsquo;s original value because:\nFor positive numbers (MSB = 0), adding leading 0s does not change the magnitude. For negative numbers (MSB = 1), adding leading 1s preserves the negative value by maintaining the two\u0026rsquo;s-complement encoding. Why Does This Work? The key is in how two\u0026rsquo;s-complement numbers are interpreted:\n$$B2T_w(\\mathbf{x}) = -x_{w-1} \\cdot 2^{w-1} + \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2} x_i \\cdot 2^i$$\nHere:\n$x_{w-1}$ is the sign bit. $x_i$ are the other bits of the number. When sign-extending to a new width $w\u0026rsquo; \u0026gt; w$, the replicated bits do not alter the value because:\nFor positive numbers ($x_{w-1} = 0$), adding leading 0s contributes nothing to the sum. For negative numbers ($x_{w-1} = 1$), adding leading 1s adds a negative offset equivalent to what would be added if the value were represented at the original width $w$. Example: 4-bit to 8-bit Let’s see an example.\nCase 1: Positive Number Consider the 4-bit number $0110$ (6 in decimal). When expanded to 8 bits:\n$$0110 \\rightarrow 00000110$$\nThe value is unchanged, as the leading 0s contribute nothing.\nCase 2: Negative Number Consider the 4-bit number $1010$ (-6 in decimal). When expanded to 8 bits:\n$$1010 \\rightarrow 11111010$$\nThe leading 1s preserve the negative value in two\u0026rsquo;s-complement, keeping it as -6.\nThis process guarantees that the number\u0026rsquo;s value remains consistent regardless of its width.\n[[虎码用法记录.zh-cn]]\n","date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/how-could-the-number-of-bigger-data-type-with-leading-1-equals-to-the-original-number/","title":"How could the number of bigger data type with leading 1 equals to the original number?"},{"content":"You:\nI\u0026rsquo;m learning csapp, please explain me why $T2U_{w}(-1) = UMax_{w}$.\nChatGPT:\nThe equation $T2U_w(-1) = UMax_w$ comes from the relationship between signed and unsigned integer representations in two\u0026rsquo;s complement arithmetic.\nHere’s why it holds:\nTwo\u0026rsquo;s Complement Representation:\nIn $w$-bit two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation, the signed integer $-1$ is represented as a bit pattern where all $w$ bits are $1$. For example, in 4 bits, $-1$ is $1111_2$. Interpreting the Bit Pattern as Unsigned:\nWhen interpreted as an unsigned number, the bit pattern $1111_2$ corresponds to the maximum unsigned value for $w$ bits, which is $2^w - 1$. This is because all $w$ bits contribute their maximum weight to the value. For example:\nIn 4 bits: $1111_2 = 2^4 - 1 = 15$. In 8 bits: $11111111_2 = 2^8 - 1 = 255$. Generalization:\nThe function $T2U_w(x)$ takes a signed integer $x$ and converts its two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation to an unsigned integer interpretation. For $x = -1$, the bit pattern is all $1$\u0026rsquo;s, so $T2U_w(-1) = UMax_w$, where $UMax_w = 2^w - 1$ is the maximum unsigned value for $w$ bits. Conclusion The equation $T2U_w(-1) = UMax_w$ reflects the dual interpretation of the same bit pattern under two\u0026rsquo;s complement (signed) and unsigned interpretations. The bit pattern for $-1$ in two\u0026rsquo;s complement is always the largest possible value in unsigned representation.\nYou:\nif -1 in two\u0026rsquo;s complement is represented by $1111_2$, how is the $TMin_2$ represented?\nChatGPT:\nIn two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation, the minimum signed value ($TMin_w$) for $w$-bit integers is represented by a bit pattern where the most significant bit (MSB) is $1$ and all other bits are $0$.\nFor $w = 2$, the minimum value ($TMin_2$) is represented as:\n$$10_2$$\nExplanation: Range of Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement Values:\nFor $w$-bit two\u0026rsquo;s complement, the range of values is: $$TMin_w = -2^{w-1} \\quad \\text{to} \\quad TMax_w = 2^{w-1} - 1$$ For $w = 2$, this range is: $$TMin_2 = -2^{2-1} = -2, \\quad TMax_2 = 2^{2-1} - 1 = 1$$ Bit Pattern for $TMin_2$:\nThe MSB in two\u0026rsquo;s complement indicates the sign of the number: $0$: Non-negative. $1$: Negative. $TMin_w$ is the most negative number, so its MSB is $1$, and all other bits are $0$. For $w = 2$, $TMin_2$ is: $$10_2$$ Verification:\nThe bit pattern $10_2$ represents: $$-2^{1} + 0 \\cdot 2^{0} = -2$$ This matches $TMin_2$. Summary: For $w = 2$, $TMin_2$ ($-2$) is represented by the bit pattern $10_2$.\nYou:\nIf the MSB is represent for a sign, how can it also be a counted number and involve in the calculation of its value?\nChatGPT:\nGreat question! This is a key insight into how two\u0026rsquo;s complement works—it combines the sign and value representation in a single system, allowing arithmetic operations to proceed uniformly without special handling for positive and negative numbers.\nHere’s how it works:\n1. The Role of the MSB in Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement In $w$-bit two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation:\nThe most significant bit (MSB) is indeed the sign bit: $0$: Non-negative. $1$: Negative. However, the MSB also contributes to the numerical value of the number. This is achieved by assigning the MSB a negative weight, making it part of the number\u0026rsquo;s representation. 2. Signed Value Calculation in Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement The value of a $w$-bit number in two\u0026rsquo;s complement is computed as:\n$$\\text{Value} = -2^{w-1} \\cdot \\text{MSB} + \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2} 2^i \\cdot \\text{bit}[i]$$\nThe MSB contributes $-2^{w-1}$ if it is $1$, which gives the number its negative weight. All other bits ($\\text{bit}[i]$) contribute their usual positive weights. 3. Example: 4-Bit Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement Let’s illustrate with $w = 4$:\nPositive Number ($0101_2$): $$\\text{MSB} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Value} = 0 \\cdot (-2^3) + 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5$$\nNegative Number ($1011_2$): $$\\text{MSB} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Value} = 1 \\cdot (-2^3) + 0 \\cdot 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = -8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = -5$$\nNotice how the MSB flips the numerical value into the negative range when it is $1$.\n4. Why This Works for Arithmetic By interpreting the MSB as $-2^{w-1}$, two\u0026rsquo;s complement ensures:\nArithmetic (addition and subtraction) can be performed without special handling for signed and unsigned numbers. Overflow detection and handling become consistent with bit manipulation rules. For instance:\nAdding $0101_2$ ($+5$) and $1011_2$ ($-5$) in two\u0026rsquo;s complement directly gives $0000_2$ ($0$). 5. Intuition The MSB’s dual role as both the sign and a weighted bit is the magic of two\u0026rsquo;s complement. It ensures that the entire binary number encodes both the magnitude and the sign seamlessly, allowing all bits—including the MSB—to be treated consistently in calculations.\n","date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/why-does-a-twos-complement-encoded-1-convert-to-unsigned-encoding-would-be-the-max-value-of-unsiged-number-t2u_w-1-umax_w/","title":"why does a two's complement encoded -1 convert to unsigned encoding would be the max value of unsiged number?

However, there is a conflict in their rendering of images.\nHugo accesses all sources from its root, while obsidian vault gets images from its root too (which isn\u0026rsquo;t the same path as hugo\u0026rsquo;s root). This result in mismatched URLs in markdown files.\nFortunately, Hugo provides a mounting functionality that enable remapping paths within the project. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of my solution.\nFirst, I have a Hugo project called blog, with a directory structure like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 blog/ ├── static/ │ ├── favicon.ico │ └── css/ ├── content/ │ └── post/ │ ├── file.md │ └── ... ├── ... I use the content/post directory as my Obsidian vault. When I want to insert an image img.png (placed in content/post/_images) into file.md, I tried these URLs: ![alt image](_image/img.png) and ![alt image](img.png). Both rendered correctly in obsidian but failed in both local and remote Hugo sites for the reason mentioned above.\nTo solve this, we need to let Hugo know where we put the images. Add these configuration in your Hugo config file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;content/post/_images\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static/_images\u0026#39; Here is the explanation:\nThe first mount with same static source and target aims to prevent resources in default Hugo static directory from overwritten. The second mount maps content/post/_images to static/_images, allowing both Hugo site and Obsidian to resolve the _images path properly. Important notes:\nHugo will combine all configuration files into one, and place it in the project root. Therefore, paths in the Hugo config above should start from current directory without leading slash /. The static directory will be integrated and disappear, and image URLs in markdown files shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a leading / as it will be interpreted as your host root rather than Hugo project root. Here are the different test results showing how the presence of leading / in an image URLs affects remote and local Hugo sites:\nbaseurl img url remote local xxx.io/ /_images/img.png failed succeed xxx.io/ _images/img.png succeed succeed xxx.io/blog /_images/img.png failed failed xxx.io/blog _images/img.png succeed succeed Note: Only Obsidian can render images without the /_images prefix; both remote and local sites requires it.\nDetailed outcomes:\nbaseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local failed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png; local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png The key finding is that baseurl only affects the local site behavior.

The actual implementation uses a combination of DRAM, flash memory, disk storage,special hardware, and operating system software to provide the program with what apears to be a monolithic byte array.\nThe GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) can compile programs according to the conventions of several different version of the C language, based on different command-line options.\n2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation Decimal and binary values associated with the hexadecimal digits:\npractice problem 2.1: A. 0x25B9D2 to binary B. binary 1010111001001001 to hexadecimal C. 0xA8B3D to binary D. binary 1100100010110110010110 to hexadecimal\nFor $x = 2,048 = 2^{11}$, we have $n = 11 = 3 + 4 \\cdot 2$, giving hexdecimal representation 0x800.\n2.1.2 Data Sizes A 32-bit word size limits the virtual address space to 4 gigabytes(written 4 GB), that is, just over 4 x 10^9 bytes. Scaling up to a 64-bit word size leads to a virtual address space of 16 exabytes, or around 1.84 x 10^19 bytes.\nThe distinction referring to programs as being either \u0026ldquo;32-bit programs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;64-bit programs\u0026rdquo; lies in how a program is compiled, rather than the type of machine on which it runs.\nThe C language supports multiple data formats for both integer and floating-piont data.\nint32_t and int64_t have exactly 4 and 8 bytes, respectively, to avoid the vagaries of relying on \u0026ldquo;typical\u0026rdquo; sizes and different compiler settings.\n2.1.3 Addressing and Byte Ordering The convention where the least significant bytes comes first is referred to as little endian. The convention where the most sifnificant byte comes first is referred to as big endian.\nAlthough the floating-pint and the integer data both encode the numeric value 12,345, they have very different byte patterns: 0x00003039 for the integer and 0x4640E400 for floating point. In general, these two formats use different encoding shemes. If we expand these hexadecimal patterns into binary form and shift them appropriately, we find a sequence of 13 matching bits, indicated by a sequence of asterisks, as follows:\n2.1.4 Representing Strings None\n2.1.5 Representing Code None\n2.1.6 Introduction to Boolean Algebra When we consider operations ^, \u0026amp; and ~ operating on bit vectors of length w, we get a different mathematical form, known as a Boolean ring.\na ^ a = 0 for any value a, so (a ^ b) ^ a = b.\nAccording to the position of 1 from right to left, bit vector a = [01101001] encodes the set A = {0, 3, 5, 6}, while bit vector b = [01010101] encodes the set B = {0, 2, 4, 6}. Then the operation a \u0026amp; b yields bit vector [01000001], while $A \\cap B$ = {0, 6}.\n2.1.7 Bit-Level Operations in C The best way to determin the effect of a bit-level expression is to extend the hexadecimal arguments to their binary representations, perform the operations in binary, and then convert back to the hexadecimal.\nA mask is a bit pattern that indicates a selected set of bits within a word. The expression ~0 will yield a mask of all ones.\n2.1.8 Logical Operations in C A bitwise operation will have behavior matching that of its logical counterpart only in the special case in which the arguments are restricted to 0 or 1.\nThe logical operators do not evaluate their second argument if the result of the expression can be determined by evaluating the first argument.\n2.1.9 Shift Operations in C x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; k: $x$ is shifted $k$ bits to the left, dropping off the $k$ most significant bits and filling the right end with $k$ zeros.\nx \u0026gt;\u0026gt; k:\nLogical. A logical right shift fills the left end with $k$ zeros. Arithmetic. An arithemetic right shift fills the left end with $k$ repetitions of the most significant bit. Arithmetic is the most-used right shift for signed data. But for unsigned data it must be logical right shift. On many machines, the shift instruction consider only the lower $log_2 w$ bits of the shift amount when shifting a w-bit value, and so the shift amount is computed as k mod w. w is the bit length of the data type. For instance:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 int x = 1; int w = 32; // 32-bit integer // These will give identical results: x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 3 // shift by 3 x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 35 // shift by 35 (35 mod 32 = 3) x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 67 // shift by 67 (67 mod 32 = 3) // Because: 3 in binary = 00011 (lowest 5 bits) 35 in binary = 100011 (lowest 5 bits = 00011) 67 in binary = 1000011 (lowest 5 bits = 00011) 2.2 Integer Representations 2.2.1 Integral Data Types 2.2.2 Unsigned Encodings principle: Definition of unsigned encoding\nFor vector $\\vec{x} = [x_{w-1}, x_{w-2}, \\ldots, x_{0}$: $$ B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{w-1}x_{i}2^i \\qquad (2.1) $$\nThe least value is given by bit vector $[00 \\cdots 0]$ having integer value 0, and the greatest value is given by bit vector $[11 \\cdots 1]$ having integer value $UMax_{w} \\doteq \\sum_{i=0}^{w-1}2^i = 2^w - 1$.\nprinciple: Uniqueness of unsigned encoding\nFunction $B2U_{w}$ is a bijection.\n2.2.3 Two’s-Complement Encodings principle: Definition of two’s-complement encoding\nFor vector $\\vec{x} = [x_{w-1},x_{w-2},\\cdots x_{0}]$: $$ B2T_{w}(\\vec{x}) \\doteq -x_{w-1}2^{w-1} + \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2}x_{i}2^{i} \\qquad (2.3) $$\nThe MSB (most significant bit) has its dual role as both the sign and a weighted bit.\nThe least representable value is given by bitvector [10 ... 0] (set the bit with negative weight but clear all others),having integer value $TMin_{w} \\doteq - 2^{w-1}$.The greatest value is given by bitvector [01 ... 1] (clear the bit with negative weight but set all others),having integer value $Tmax_{w} \\doteq \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2}2^i = 2^{w} - 1$.\nprinciple: Uniqueness of two’s-complement encoding\nFunction $B2T_{w}$ is a bijection.\n$\\left| TMin \\right| = \\left| TMax \\right| + 1$\nSince 0 is nonnegative, this means that it can represent one less positive number than negative.\nTwo other standard representations for signed numbers: $$ B2O_{w}(\\vec{x}) \\doteq -x_{w-1}(2^{w-1} - 1) + \\sum {i=0}^{w-2}x{i}2^{i} $$ $$ B2S_{w}(\\vec{x}) \\doteq (-1)^{x_{w-1}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum {i = 0}^{w-2}x{i}2^{i} \\right) $$\n2.2.4 Conversions between Signed and Unsigned $$ T2U_{w}\\left( \\vec{x} \\right) \\doteq B2U_{w}\\left( T2B_{w} \\right) $$ $$ U2T_{w}\\left( \\vec{x} \\right) \\doteq B2T_{w}\\left( U2B_{w} \\right) $$\nprinciple: Conversion from two’s complement to unsigned\nFor x such that $TMinw ≤ x ≤ TMaxw$: $$ T2U_{w}\\left( x \\right) = \\begin{cases} x + 2^{w}, \u0026amp; x \u0026lt; 0 \\ x, \u0026amp; x \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\qquad (2.5) $$\nderivation: Conversion from two’s complement to unsigned\nComparing Equations 2.1 and 2.3, we can see that for bit pattern $\\vec{x}$, if we compute the difference $B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) - B2T_{w}(\\vec{x})$, the weighted sums for bits from 0 to w - 2 will cancel each other, leaving a value $B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) - B2T_{w}(\\vec{x}) = x_{w-1} (2^{w-1} - -2^{w-1}) = x_{w-1}2^{w}$. This gives a relationship $B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) = B2T_{w}(\\vec{x}) + x_{w-1}2^{w}$. We therefore have $$ B2U_{w}(T2B_{w}(x)) = T2U_{w}(x) = x ;+;x_{w-1}2^{w} \\qquad (2.6) $$\nFor the two’s-complement case, the most significant bit serves as the sign bit, which we diagram as a leftward-pointing gray bar. For the unsigned case, this bit has positive weight, which we show as a rightward-pointing black bar.\nprinciple: Unsigned to two’s-complement conversion For u such that $0 \\leq u \\leq UMax_{w}$: $$ U2T_{w}(u) = \\begin{cases} u, \u0026amp; u \\leq TMax_{w} \\ u - 2^{w}, \u0026amp; u \u0026gt; Tmax_{w} \\end{cases} \\qquad (2.7) $$\nderivation: Unsigned to two’s-complement conversion Let $\\vec{u} = U2B_{w}(u)$. This bit vector will also be the two’s-complement representation of $U2T_{w}(u)$. Equations 2.1 and 2.3 can be combined to give $$ U2T_{w}(u) = -u_{w-1}2^{w} + u \\qquad (2.8) $$\nTo summarize, we considered the effects of converting in both directions between unsigned and two’s-complement representations. For values x in the range $0 \\leq x \\leq TMax_{w}$, we have $T2U_{w}(x) = x$ and $U2T_{w}(x) = x$. That is, numbers in this range have identical unsigned and two’s-complement representations. For values outside of this range, the conversions either add or subtract $2^{w}$. For example, we have $T2U_{w}(-1) = -1 + 2^{w}$ -the negative number closest to zero maps to the largest unsigned number. At the other extreme, one can see that $T2U_{w}(TMin_{w}) = -2^{w-1} + 2^{w} = 2^{w-1} = TMax_{w} - 1$ —the most negative number maps to an unsigned number just outside the range of positive two’s-complement numbers. Using the example of Figure 2.15, we can see that $T2U_{16}(-12345) = 65536 + -12345 = 53191$.\n2.2.5 Signed versus Unsigned in C From here on, since repeatedly taking screenshots and copying key words is very troublesome, I will only record key words that help with memory as summarized by myself, which also serves as an index.\nmost signed by default, suffix u for unsigned\n%d, %u, and %x a signed decimal, an unsigned decimal, and in hexadecimal format\npossible, print, int with %u, unsigned with %d\nresult of the expression -1 \u0026lt; 0U is 0 and unsigned, since 0U is unsigned, -1 is implicitly cast to unsigned, which is $T2U_{w}(-1) = UMax_{w} = 4294967295U$.\n2.2.6 Expanding the Bit Representation of a Number unsigned -\u0026gt; large data type =\u0026gt; add leading zeros\ntwo\u0026rsquo;s-complement -\u0026gt;\n[](how could)\n","date":"2024-11-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/csapp-reading-notes-chapter-2-part-i/","title":"CSAPP reading notes - Chapter 2 (Part I)"},{"content":"Linux First run the command in the terminal: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\nThis command get and execute a shell script from the certain website, which downloads the necessary tools and environments.\nHere is the explanation of the flag of curl:\n-s, shows no output. -S, BUT error message. -f, silent failure on HTTP errors, which means only return an error code instead of the whole messages. then use the command below to source the environment: . ~/.cargo/env\n","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/cargo-installation/","title":"cargo installation"},{"content":"Linux go1.23.2 for instance:\n1 2 wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz rm -rf /usr/local/go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.23.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz then add\n1 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin to the profile and run the source ~/.zshrc command.\n","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/go-installation/","title":"go installation"},{"content":"Tutorial link: LazyVim for Ambitious Developers\nIn keybindings, C means Ctrl.\nChapter 1.

Yet the gifts they buy for each other require exactly these things as a foundation - Della buys a long chain for Jim\u0026rsquo;s pocket watch for decoration, and Jim buys a comb for Della\u0026rsquo;s hair. One is struck by the unexpectedness of the situation, but also by their true love.\n02 The Last Leaf This story is mainly about a girl with Pneumonia, Johnsy, because the leaves of the vines outside of window are about to fall off, touched the feelings, and lost the confidentce in life, but did not expect that even after a night of wind and rain, the last leaf is still not blown off, thus regained the courage to live, after getting well, and found that the original leaf is downstairs, the painter who is also suffering from Pneumonia, Mr. Behrman, in order to encourage Johnsy to paint.\n03 After Twenty Years This story is mainly about two old friends who agree to meet after 20 years. One of them become police officer, but realizes that his old friend has become a wanted man in Mexico, and cannot bear to arrest him, so he asks his other plainclothes colleague to do it for him.\n04 The Cop and the Anthem The story is mainly about Soapy, a social marginalized man, who tries a various ways to commit crime intending to be caught and imprisoned, hoping to get through the cold winter, all of which end in failure. Just as he was sitting on a park bench, disheartened, he heard a beautiful song coming from the church, envoking the goodness of his heart. However, as he was planning to get a proper job and change his life with his own hands, he was arrested for loitering and sentenced to three month in prison.\n05 A Service of Love The story is about a poor couple, Joe and Delia, who came to New York City to pursue their dream of making art, but are unable to beat the reality of making a living through art. On the one hand, they don\u0026rsquo;t want their other half to give up their dream easily, on the other hand, they have to keep to live, so they hide the truth from each other, pretending they are still doing art-related work on the one hand, and doing other jobs to make a living on the other, until Delia gets sick one time before revealing the truth to each other, which makes people sigh for their love.\n06 While the Auto Waits This article is mainly about a man stumbles upon a women sitting on a bench while wandering in a park. The woman claims to be an aristocrat who wants to experience life as a commoner, and that luxury automobile parked around the corner of the park is hers. The man claimed to be a cashier at a restaurant. Their true identities are reversed: the woman is a restaurant cashier, the the man is an aristocrat, and the car is belong to him, which is very ironic.\n07 The Romance of a Busy Broker The article focuses on Maxwell, a stockbroker who has a very busy schedule, but takes time out of his busy schedule to propose to his stenographer subordinate, Leslie, only to find out that they were married at 8:00 p.m. last night in a church. The article explores the possible consequences of being too obsessed with work - neglecting or forgetting important aspects of life such as family and relationships.\n08 Furnished Room for Rent This story is about a man who travels from city to city in search of his missing beloved. At a hotel, he realizes through some clues that his current room may have been occupied by his beloved, so he goes to ask the landlord about it, but to no avail. Feeling that hope is lost and that he has lost his motivation for life, he take his life in the room. The next day, the landlords got together to discuss that a girl in the man\u0026rsquo;s room had also committed suicide a while ago.
