However, there is a conflict in their rendering of images.\nHugo accesses all sources from its root, while obsidian vault gets images from its root too (which isn\u0026rsquo;t the same path as hugo\u0026rsquo;s root). This result in mismatched URLs in markdown files.\nFortunately, Hugo provides a mounting functionality that enable remapping paths within the project. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of my solution.\nFirst, I have a Hugo project called blog, with a directory structure like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 blog/ ├── static/ │ ├── favicon.ico │ └── css/ ├── content/ │ └── post/ │ ├── file.md │ └── ... ├── ... I use the content/post directory as my Obsidian vault. When I want to insert an image img.png (placed in content/post/_images) into file.md, I tried these URLs: ![alt image](_image/img.png) and ![alt image](img.png). Both rendered correctly in obsidian but failed in both local and remote Hugo sites for the reason mentioned above.\nTo solve this, we need to let Hugo know where we put the images. Add these configuration in your Hugo config file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;content/post/_images\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static/_images\u0026#39; Here is the explanation:\nThe first mount with same static source and target aims to prevent resources in default Hugo static directory from overwritten. The second mount maps content/post/_images to static/_images, allowing both Hugo site and Obsidian to resolve the _images path properly. Important notes:\nHugo will combine all configuration files into one, and place it in the project root. Therefore, paths in the Hugo config above should start from current directory without leading slash /. The static directory will be integrated and disappear, and image URLs in markdown files shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a leading / as it will be interpreted as your host root rather than Hugo project root. Here are the different test results showing how the presence of leading / in an image URLs affects remote and local Hugo sites:\nbaseurl img url remote local xxx.io/ /_images/img.png failed succeed xxx.io/ _images/img.png succeed succeed xxx.io/blog /_images/img.png failed failed xxx.io/blog _images/img.png succeed succeed Note: Only Obsidian can render images without the /_images prefix; both remote and local sites requires it.\nDetailed outcomes:\nbaseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local failed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png; local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png The key finding is that baseurl only affects the local site behavior.

It achieves both goal via the foundamental abstractions: processes, virtual memory, and files.\n1.7.1 Processes When the operating system decides to transfer control from the current process to some new process, it performs a context switch by saving the context of the current process, restoring the context of the new process, and then passing control to the new process.\n1.7.2 Threads Each thread runs in the context of the process and sharing the same code and global data.\n1.7.3 Virtual Memory Each process has the same uniform view of memory, which is known as its virtual address space.\nThe virtual address space seen by each process consists of a number of well defined areas, starting from low to high:\nProgram code and data. Heap. Shared libraries. Stack. kernel virtual memory. 1.7.4 Files A file is a sequence of bytes. Every I/O devices is modeled as a file. All input and output in the system is performed by reading and writing files, using a small set of system calls known as Unix I/O.\n1.8 Systems Communicate with Other Systems Using Networks The network can be viewed as just another I/O devices.\nThe system copies a sequence of bytes from main memory to the network adapter rather than disk controller, which helps the data flow across the network to another mechine instead of a local disk drive.\n1.9 Important Themes 1.9.1 Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s law The main idea of Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s law is that when we speed up one part of a system effect on the overall all system performance depends on both how sigficant this part was and how much it sped up.\nSuppose some part of the system requires a fraction α of this time, and that we improve its performence by a factor of k.\n$$ T_{new} = (1-\\alpha)T_{\\text{old}} + (\\alpha T_{\\text{old}})/k = T_{\\text{old}}[(1-\\alpha) + \\alpha/k] $$\n$$ S = \\frac{T_{\\text{old}}}{T_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{1}{(1-\\alpha) + \\alpha/k} $$\n1.9.2 Concurrency and Parallelism Thread-Level Concurrency Traditionally, this concurrent execution was only simulated, much as a juggler keeps multiple balls flying through the air.\nMultiprocessor systems have more recently become commonplace with the advent of multi-core processors and hyperthreading.\nHyperthreading also called simultaneous multi-threading. Whereas a conventional processor requires around 20,000 clock style to shift between different threads, a hyperthreaded processor decides which of its threads to execute on a cycle-by-cycle basis.\nInstruction-Level Parallelism Processors that can sustain execution rates faster than 1 instruction per cycle are known as superscalar processors.\nSingle-Instruction, Multiple-Data(SIMD) Parallelism 1.9.3 The Importance of Abstractions in Computer Systems 1.10 Summary Storage devices that are higher in the hierarchy serve as caches for devices that are lower in the hierarchy.\nThe operating system kernel serves as an intermediary between the application and the hardware.

Every byte of memory is identified by a unique nubmer, known as address, and the set of all possible addresses is known as the virtual address space.\nVirtual address space is just a conceptual image presented to mechine-level program. The actual implementation uses a combination of DRAM, flash memory, disk storage,special hardware, and operating system software to provide the program with what apears to be a monolithic byte array.\nThe GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) can compile programs according to the conventions of several different version of the C language, based on different command-line options.\n2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation Decimal and binary values associated with the hexadecimal digits:\npractice problem 2.1: A. 0x25B9D2 to binary B. binary 1010111001001001 to hexadecimal C. 0xA8B3D to binary D. binary 1100100010110110010110 to hexadecimal\nFor $x = 2,048 = 2^{11}$, we have $n = 11 = 3 + 4 \\cdot 2$, giving hexdecimal representation 0x800.\n2.1.2 Data Sizes A 32-bit word size limits the virtual address space to 4 gigabytes(written 4 GB), that is, just over 4 x 10^9 bytes. Scaling up to a 64-bit word size leads to a virtual address space of 16 exabytes, or around 1.84 x 10^19 bytes.\nThe distinction referring to programs as being either \u0026ldquo;32-bit programs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;64-bit programs\u0026rdquo; lies in how a program is compiled, rather than the type of machine on which it runs.\nThe C language supports multiple data formats for both integer and floating-piont data.\nint32_t and int64_t have exactly 4 and 8 bytes, respectively, to avoid the vagaries of relying on \u0026ldquo;typical\u0026rdquo; sizes and different compiler settings.\n2.1.3 Addressing and Byte Ordering The convention where the least significant bytes comes first is referred to as little endian. The convention where the most sifnificant byte comes first is referred to as big endian.\nAlthough the floating-pint and the integer data both encode the numeric value 12,345, they have very different byte patterns: 0x00003039 for the integer and 0x4640E400 for floating point. In general, these two formats use different encoding shemes. If we expand these hexadecimal patterns into binary form and shift them appropriately, we find a sequence of 13 matching bits, indicated by a sequence of asterisks, as follows:\n2.1.4 Representing Strings None\n2.1.5 Representing Code None\n2.1.6 Introduction to Boolean Algebra When we consider operations ^, \u0026amp; and ~ operating on bit vectors of length w, we get a different mathematical form, known as a Boolean ring.\na ^ a = 0 for any value a, so (a ^ b) ^ a = b.\nAccording to the position of 1 from right to left, bit vector a = [01101001] encodes the set A = {0, 3, 5, 6}, while bit vector b = [01010101] encodes the set B = {0, 2, 4, 6}. Then the operation a \u0026amp; b yields bit vector [01000001], while $A \\cap B$ = {0, 6}.\n2.1.7 Bit-Level Operations in C The best way to determin the effect of a bit-level expression is to extend the hexadecimal arguments to their binary representations, perform the operations in binary, and then convert back to the hexadecimal.\nA mask is a bit pattern that indicates a selected set of bits within a word. The expression ~0 will yield a mask of all ones.\n2.1.8 Logical Operations in C A bitwise operation will have behavior matching that of its logical counterpart only in the special case in which the arguments are restricted to 0 or 1.\nThe logical operators do not evaluate their second argument if the result of the expression can be determined by evaluating the first argument.\n2.1.9 Shift Operations in C x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; k: $x$ is shifted $k$ bits to the left, dropping off the $k$ most significant bits and filling the right end with $k$ zeros.\nx \u0026gt;\u0026gt; k:\nLogical. A logical right shift fills the left end with $k$ zeros. Arithmetic. An arithemetic right shift fills the left end with $k$ repetitions of the most significant bit. Arithmetic is the most-used right shift for signed data. But for unsigned data it must be logical right shift. On many machines, the shift instruction consider only the lower $log_2 w$ bits of the shift amount when shifting a w-bit value, and so the shift amount is computed as k mod w. w is the bit length of the data type. For instance:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 int x = 1; int w = 32; // 32-bit integer // These will give identical results: x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 3 // shift by 3 x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 35 // shift by 35 (35 mod 32 = 3) x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 67 // shift by 67 (67 mod 32 = 3) // Because: 3 in binary = 00011 (lowest 5 bits) 35 in binary = 100011 (lowest 5 bits = 00011) 67 in binary = 1000011 (lowest 5 bits = 00011) 2.2 Integer Representations 2.2.1 Integral Data Types 2.2.2 Unsigned Encodings For vector $\\vec{x} = [x_{w-1}, x_{w-2}, \\ldots, x_{0}$: $$ B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{w-1}x_{i}2^i \\qquad (2.1) $$\nThe least value is given by bit vector $[00 \\cdots 0]$ having integer value 0, and the greatest value is given by bit vector $[11 \\cdots 1]$ having integer value $UMax_{w} \\doteq \\sum_{i=0}^{w-1}2^i = 2^w - 1$.\nprinciple: Uniqueness of unsigned encoding Function B2Uw is a bijection.\n2.2.3 Two’s-Complement Encodings For some programs, it is essential that data types be encoded using representations with specific sizes. For example, when writing programs to enable a machine to communicate over the Internet according to a standard protocol, it is important to have data types compatible with those specified by the protocol. We have seen that some C data types, especially long, have different ranges on different machines, and in fact the C standards only specify the minimum ranges for any data type, not the exact ranges. Although we can choose data types that will be compatible with standard representations on most machines, there is no guarantee of portability. We have already encountered the 32- and 64-bit versions of fixed-size integer types (Figure 2.3); they are part of a larger class of data types. The ISO C99 standard introduces this class of integer types in the file stdint.h. This file defines a set of data types with declarations of the form intN_t and uintN_t, specifying N-bit signed and unsigned integers, for different values of N. The exact values of N are implementation dependent, but most compilers allow values of 8, 16, 32, and 64. Thus, we can unambiguously declare an unsigned 16-bit variable by giving it type uint16_t, and a signed variable of 32 bits as int32_t. Along with these data types are a set of macros defining the minimum and maximum values for each value of N. These have names of the form INTN_MIN, INTN_MAX, and UINTN_MAX. Formatted printing with fixed-width types requires use of macros that expand into format strings in a system-dependent manner. So, for example, the values of variables x and y of type int32_t and uint64_t can be printed by the following call to printf:\n","date":"2024-11-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/csapp-reading-notes-chapter-2-part-i/","title":"CSAPP reading notes - Chapter 2 (Part I)"},{"content":"Linux First run the command in the terminal: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\nThis command get and execute a shell script from the certain website, which downloads the necessary tools and environments.\nHere is the explanation of the flag of curl:\n-s, shows no output. -S, BUT error message. -f, silent failure on HTTP errors, which means only return an error code instead of the whole messages. then use the command below to source the environment: . ~/.cargo/env\n","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/cargo-installation/","title":"cargo installation"},{"content":"Linux go1.23.2 for instance:\n1 2 wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz rm -rf /usr/local/go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.23.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz then add\n1 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin to the profile and run the source ~/.zshrc command.\n","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/go-installation/","title":"go installation"},{"content":"Tutorial link: LazyVim for Ambitious Developers\nIn keybindings, C means Ctrl.\nChapter 1.

Basic Editing keys:\n80i*\u0026lt;Escape\u0026gt; will insert 80 * which is nifty. dsfoos, delete from the cursor to the first character of the target word foo. X delete the character before the cursor. J to join lines. gU\u0026lt;range\u0026gt; will convert a character of a sequence of characters into uppercase, while the gu\u0026lt;range\u0026gt; is the inverse.\n~ inverts the case of character under the cursor.\nq\u0026lt;reg_name\u0026gt; will start recording a sequence of operations which called macro, and press q again will stop the recording. The fastest way to play back the latest macro is press Q, or you can use @\u0026lt;reg_name\u0026gt; instead.\nChapter 7.
