[{"content":"You: what is the difference among hard, soft, and mixed reset in git commit ?\nChatGPT: In Git, the terms hard reset, soft reset, and mixed reset refer to different types of actions when resetting the state of your repository. These actions affect the commit history, the staging area (index), and the working directory differently.\n1. Hard Reset Command: git reset --hard \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; Effect: Moves the current branch pointer (HEAD) to the specified commit. Resets the staging area (index) to match the specified commit. Resets the working directory to match the specified commit (overwrites any changes in tracked files). Use Case: When you want to completely discard changes in the working directory and staging area, making the repository state exactly like the specified commit. Caution: Irreversible if the discarded changes aren\u0026rsquo;t saved elsewhere (e.g., uncommitted changes or commits are not recoverable unless backed up). 2. Soft Reset Command: git reset --soft \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; Effect: Moves the current branch pointer (HEAD) to the specified commit. Does not reset the staging area (index). Does not reset the working directory. Use Case: When you want to undo commits but keep the changes in the staging area so you can edit or re-commit them. Example: Use this if you realize that the last commit message is incorrect and want to modify it. 3. Mixed Reset (Default) Command: git reset --mixed \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; or git reset \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; (default behavior). Effect: Moves the current branch pointer (HEAD) to the specified commit. Resets the staging area (index) to match the specified commit. Does not reset the working directory. Use Case: When you want to undo commits and unstage changes (but keep them in the working directory) for further modifications or staging. Example: Use this if you mistakenly committed changes and want to refine or split them into different commits. Summary Table: Action HEAD (Commit Pointer) Staging Area (Index) Working Directory Hard Reset Moves Resets Resets (Overwrites) Soft Reset Moves Unchanged Unchanged Mixed Reset Moves Resets Unchanged Example Usage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Hard reset (dangerous): git reset --hard HEAD~1 # Undo the last commit completely. # Soft reset: git reset --soft HEAD~1 # Undo the last commit, keep changes staged. # Mixed reset (default): git reset HEAD~1 # Undo the last commit, unstage changes, keep them in the working directory.

This allows the compiler to make optimizations, as it assumes no other pointer will access or modify the memory that restrict points to.\nThis keyword is particularly useful in performance-critical applications such as numerical computing or multimedia processing. Here\u0026rsquo;s an explanation and example:\nKey Features of restrict: Single Ownership: The pointer marked as restrict is the sole reference to the object it points to. Optimization: By guaranteeing that no aliasing occurs, the compiler can optimize memory access more aggressively, e.g., by reordering reads and writes or avoiding unnecessary loads/stores. Example Without restrict: 1 2 3 4 5 void add_arrays(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) { for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; i++) { c[i] = a[i] + b[i]; } } Here, the compiler cannot assume that the memory regions pointed to by a, b, and c do not overlap. Therefore, it must handle memory accesses conservatively.\nExample With restrict: 1 2 3 4 5 void add_arrays(int *restrict a, int *restrict b, int *restrict c, int n) { for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; i++) { c[i] = a[i] + b[i]; } } By adding restrict, you inform the compiler that:\na, b, and c point to non-overlapping regions of memory. This allows the compiler to make optimizations such as unrolling loops or using SIMD instructions. Key Points to Remember: Responsibility: It is the programmer\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that no aliasing occurs when using restrict. Violating this assumption results in undefined behavior. Scope: The restrict qualifier applies only to the lifetime of the pointer. If the pointer is reassigned, the restriction no longer applies. Practical Use: restrict is often used in performance-critical code and library implementations where aliasing can inhibit compiler optimizations, such as in matrix operations, image processing, and signal processing.\nExample with Potential Aliasing Problem: 1 2 3 4 void example(int *a, int *b) { *a = *b + 1; *b = *a + 2; // Without `restrict`, the compiler assumes `a` might alias `b`. } By marking the pointers as restrict, you assure the compiler that a and b refer to distinct objects, enabling better optimizations.\n","date":"2024-12-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/usage-of-restrict-keyword-in-c/","title":"usage of `restrict` keyword in c"},{"content":"%s/^\\./-/g, delete all the . within a file at the beginning of each line.\n","date":"2024-12-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/learn-vim-command-line-through-examples/","title":"learn vim command line through examples"},{"content":"You: procedure:\nc void float_eg() { int x = 3490593; float f = (float)x; printf(\u0026ldquo;For x = %d\\n\u0026rdquo;, x); show_int(x); show_float(f);\nx = 3510593; f = (float)x; printf(\u0026ldquo;For x = %d\\n\u0026rdquo;, x); show_int(x); show_float(f); }\noutput:\nsh For x = 3490593 21 43 35 00 84 0c 55 4a For x = 3510593 41 91 35 00 04 45 56 4a\nplease explain as well\nChatGPT: The float_eg procedure demonstrates how a 32-bit integer is converted to a 32-bit floating-point value in memory (following the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point representation). Let\u0026rsquo;s break down the output and understand what is happening.\nKey Concepts Integer Representation (show_int):\nIntegers are stored as 4 bytes (32 bits) in memory. The show_int function prints the raw bytes of the integer in little-endian format, where the least significant byte (LSB) is stored first. Floating-Point Representation (show_float):\nFloating-point numbers follow the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision (32-bit) representation: 1 bit for the sign. 8 bits for the exponent (biased by 127). 23 bits for the fractional part (mantissa), with an implicit leading 1. Conversion from Integer to Float:\nWhen an integer is converted to a float, the value is approximated in the floating-point format, which may result in rounding errors. The integer value is scaled and packed into the floating-point format. Breakdown of the Output For x = 3490593: Integer Representation (show_int):\n3490593 in hexadecimal: 0x00354321. In little-endian format: 21 43 35 00. The LSB (21) is stored first, followed by 43, 35, and 00. Floating-Point Representation (show_float):\n3490593 is converted to floating-point: Binary representation of 3490593: 110101000110001000001 (23 significant bits).

Final bytes: 04 45 56 4a. Explanation of Differences Integer Bytes:\nThe difference between the integer byte sequences (21 43 35 00 vs. 41 91 35 00) reflects the different values of x. Floating-Point Bytes:\nThe difference in floating-point byte sequences (84 0c 55 4a vs. 04 45 56 4a) arises because: The binary representations of the integers are slightly different. The normalization step and rounding during the float conversion result in changes to the mantissa and possibly other components. Summary The output illustrates how integers are stored and how they are converted to floating-point values. The integer byte sequences represent the exact binary values of x, while the floating-point sequences represent the IEEE 754 approximations. Differences in the outputs for x = 3490593 and x = 3510593 arise due to the changes in the integer values and the way they are normalized and rounded in the floating-point format.\nYou: why does the 21-bit 110101000110001000001 have 23 significant bits?\nChatGPT: The reason the 21-bit binary representation of 3490593 appears to have 23 significant bits in the IEEE 754 floating-point format is due to the normalization process of floating-point numbers and the inclusion of an implicit leading 1 in the representation.\nLet’s break it down step by step:\n1. The Binary Representation of 3490593 The decimal number 3490593 in binary is:\n1 110101000110001000001 This representation has 21 bits. 2. Normalization in IEEE 754 To represent a floating-point number, the value is normalized into the form:\n1 1.xxx...xxx × 2^E The leading 1 in the significand (mantissa) is implicit in the IEEE 754 format and is not stored in the floating-point representation.\nFor 3490593, the normalized form is:\n1 1.10101000110001000001 × 2^21 The 1. before the decimal point is implicit and not counted in the explicit bits of the stored mantissa. 3. Representation of the Mantissa After normalization:\nThe fractional part (10101000110001000001) of the significand is explicitly stored in the IEEE 754 format. This fractional part has up to 23 bits (for single-precision floats). For 3490593, we only need 21 bits to represent the fractional part (10101000110001000001), but the IEEE 754 standard always reserves space for 23 bits in the mantissa:\nThe extra two bits are filled with 0s, resulting in:\n1 10101000110001000001000 4. Why 23 Bits? The IEEE 754 format specifies 23 bits for the mantissa to ensure precision for a wide range of numbers.\nIn single-precision:\n1 bit is reserved for the sign. 8 bits are reserved for the exponent. 23 bits are reserved for the fractional part of the significand. Even if the original number has fewer significant bits (e.g., 21 in this case), the mantissa field will always be 23 bits, padded with 0s if necessary.\nKey Insight The 23 bits of the mantissa in IEEE 754 include only the fractional part of the significand, as the leading 1 is implicit. In this case, the 21-bit binary number (110101000110001000001) becomes 23 bits after:\nNormalization (1.10101000110001000001). Storing the fractional part (10101000110001000001000) in the mantissa field. This ensures compliance with the IEEE 754 standard, even if the number\u0026rsquo;s original binary representation is shorter than 23 bits.\n","date":"2024-12-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/conversion-from-2s-complement-integer-to-floating-point-number/","title":"Conversion from 2's complement integer to floating point number"},{"content":"You: 1 2 3 4 5 6 int is_little_endian() { /* $begin is-little-endian */ int x = 1; return (int)(*(char *)\u0026amp;x); /* $end is-little-endian */ } why can these code judge whether a machine is little-endian or big-endian?\nChatGPT: This code determines whether a machine uses little-endian or big-endian byte order based on how integers are stored in memory. Let’s break it down:\nUnderstanding Byte Order Little-endian: The least significant byte (LSB) of a number is stored at the lowest memory address. Big-endian: The most significant byte (MSB) of a number is stored at the lowest memory address. For example, consider the integer 1 in binary:\n1 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001 In little-endian, it is stored as: 01 00 00 00 (from low to high memory addresses). In big-endian, it is stored as: 00 00 00 01. The Code Explanation int x = 1;\nThe integer x is assigned the value 1. (char *)\u0026amp;x\nThis casts the address of x to a char*, which allows access to individual bytes of x because char is 1 byte in size. *(char *)\u0026amp;x\nDereferencing the char* pointer reads the first byte of x (the byte stored at the lowest memory address). (int)(*(char *)\u0026amp;x)\nThe value of this byte is returned as an integer. Why This Works If the machine is little-endian, the first byte of x (at the lowest memory address) is 1 because the least significant byte is stored first. If the machine is big-endian, the first byte of x is 0 because the most significant byte is stored first. Return Value On a little-endian machine: The function returns 1. On a big-endian machine: The function returns 0. Visualization Memory layout for x = 1 on a little-endian machine:\n1 2 3 4 5 Address Value 0x1000 0x01 (LSB) 0x1001 0x00 0x1002 0x00 0x1003 0x00 Memory layout for x = 1 on a big-endian machine:\n1 2 3 4 5 Address Value 0x1000 0x00 (MSB) 0x1001 0x00 0x1002 0x00 0x1003 0x01 Thus, by checking the value of the first byte, the function identifies the endianness.\nYou: give me some examples showing the difference between little-endian and big-endian.\nChatGPT: Examples of Little-Endian vs Big-Endian To understand the difference, let\u0026rsquo;s consider several data representations and how they are stored in memory.

Multi-Byte String String: \u0026quot;ABCD\u0026quot; (4 characters, ASCII encoded) Each character in ASCII occupies 1 byte:\nA = 0x41\nB = 0x42\nC = 0x43\nD = 0x44\nLittle-Endian:\n1 2 3 4 5 Address Value 0x00 0x41 (A) 0x01 0x42 (B) 0x02 0x43 (C) 0x03 0x44 (D) Strings are typically stored as they are, but since strings don\u0026rsquo;t involve multi-byte endian concerns, the sequence remains: 41 42 43 44.\nBig-Endian:\n1 2 3 4 5 Address Value 0x00 0x41 (A) 0x01 0x42 (B) 0x02 0x43 (C) 0x03 0x44 (D) Strings behave the same way in both formats: 41 42 43 44.\n5. Practical Use Cases 5.1 Network Protocols (Big-Endian Preferred) Internet protocols such as TCP/IP use big-endian order for transmitting data. Example: IP Address 192.0.2.1 in hexadecimal is 0xC0000201: Sent over the network (big-endian): C0 00 02 01. 5.2 x86 Processors (Little-Endian Preferred) Intel x86 and AMD processors store data in little-endian format. Example: Integer 0x1234 on x86: Stored in memory (little-endian): 34 12. These examples demonstrate how data layout changes between little-endian and big-endian formats, particularly for multi-byte values like integers and floats.\n","date":"2024-12-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/how-to-judge-whether-a-machine-is-little-endian-or-big-endian/","title":"how to judge whether a machine is little-endian or big-endian?"},{"content":"ChatGPT: The formula $x\u0026rsquo; = x \\mod 2^k$ describes the process of truncating a larger bit vector $x$ (with $w$ bits) down to $k$ bits. Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down step by step to understand how and why this works.\n1. Bit Vector Representation Let $x$ be a $w$-bit binary number, represented as:\n$$x = [X_{w-1}, X_{w-2}, \\dots, X_0]$$\nHere:\n$X_{w-1}$ is the most significant bit (MSB). $X_0$ is the least significant bit (LSB). Each bit $X_i$ represents a binary digit (0 or 1). The numerical value of $x$ in base 10 (assuming it is unsigned) is:\n$$x = X_{w-1} \\cdot 2^{w-1} + X_{w-2} \\cdot 2^{w-2} + \\dots + X_0 \\cdot 2^0$$\n2. Truncating to $k$-Bits Truncating $x$ to $k$-bits means keeping only the lower $k$ bits of the bit vector:\n$$x\u0026rsquo; = [X_{k-1}, X_{k-2}, \\dots, X_0]$$\nThe higher-order bits $[X_{w-1}, \\dots, X_k]$ are discarded.\nThe value of $x\u0026rsquo;$ in base 10 is:\n$$x\u0026rsquo; = X_{k-1} \\cdot 2^{k-1} + X_{k-2} \\cdot 2^{k-2} + \\dots + X_0 \\cdot 2^0$$\n3. Understanding $x\u0026rsquo; = x \\mod 2^k$ The modulus operation $x \\mod 2^k$ keeps only the remainder when $x$ is divided by $2^k$. In binary terms, this is equivalent to ignoring all bits above the $k$-th bit.\nThe higher-order bits of $x$ (those with weights $2^i$ for $i \\geq k$) do not contribute to the result because their weights are multiples of $2^k$, and:\n$$(2^i) \\mod 2^k = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\geq k$$\nTherefore, $x \\mod 2^k$ retains only the lower $k$ bits of $x$, which is exactly what $x\u0026rsquo;$ represents after truncation.\n4. Intuition with an Example Suppose:\n$x = 27$ (in decimal) or $11011_2$ (5 bits). We want to truncate $x$ to $k = 3$ bits. Step 1: Truncate to 3 bits Retain only the lower 3 bits: $x\u0026rsquo; = 011_2$, which is $3$ in decimal. Step 2: Compute $x \\mod 2^3$ $2^3 = 8$. $x \\mod 8 = 27 \\mod 8 = 3$. Result: The truncated value $x\u0026rsquo; = 3$ matches $x \\mod 2^k$. 5. Why This Works The principle works because in binary arithmetic:\nModulus by $2^k$ eliminates all bits at positions $k$ and higher, leaving only the lower $k$ bits. Truncating a bit vector to $k$ bits achieves the exact same result by simply discarding the higher-order bits. This is why the truncated value $x\u0026rsquo;$ is equivalent to $x \\mod 2^k$.\n","date":"2024-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/why-does-the-modula-of-x-mod-2-to-k-power-will-retain-k-bits/","title":"why does the modula of `x mod 2 to k power` will retain k bits"},{"content":"You: explain the truncation more detailed\nChatGPT: Let’s dive deeper into what happens when an int is truncated to a short in your program.\nKey Background Concepts Size of Data Types:\nint: Typically 4 bytes (32 bits) on most modern platforms. short: Typically 2 bytes (16 bits). The exact sizes depend on the platform and compiler but follow the standard: sizeof(short) ≤ sizeof(int). Truncation:\nWhen you cast a larger data type (int, 32 bits) to a smaller data type (short, 16 bits), only the least significant bits (LSBs) that fit into the smaller type are retained. Any bits beyond the size of the smaller type (the most significant bits, MSBs) are discarded. Signed Representation:\nshort is a signed type, meaning it uses the most significant bit (MSB) as the sign bit: 0: Positive number. 1: Negative number (two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation). Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis of Truncation Step 1: Initial Value of x x = 53191 (in decimal).\nIn hexadecimal, 53191 is represented as:\n0x0000CF47 (32 bits).\n1 0000 0000 1100 1111 0100 0111 (binary) Step 2: Casting x to short (sx) When x is cast to a short, only the least significant 16 bits are kept:\n1 1100 1111 0100 0111 (binary) This corresponds to 0xCF47 in hexadecimal. Now, the value is interpreted as a 16-bit signed number:\nThe MSB (1) indicates that the value is negative (two\u0026rsquo;s complement). To find the value of a negative number in two\u0026rsquo;s complement: Invert the bits:\n1 0011 0000 1011 1000 Add 1 to the result:\n1 0011 0000 1011 1001 (binary) = 12345 (decimal) The result is -12345.\nSo, sx becomes -12345 after truncation.\nStep 3: Assigning sx to y When sx is assigned to y (an int), no truncation occurs because int can hold all the values of short. The value of sx (-12345) is preserved, so y = -12345. Summary of Truncation Before Truncation: x = 53191 (0x0000CF47 in 32 bits). After Truncation to short: Only the lower 16 bits are kept: 0xCF47. Interpretation as a Signed 16-bit Integer: 0xCF47 is -12345 in two\u0026rsquo;s complement. Value in y: The value -12345 is preserved when expanded back to 32-bit int. This truncation occurs because casting between different data types in C operates at the bit level without considering the original value\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;semantic\u0026rdquo; meaning.\n","date":"2024-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/why-would-int-53191-become-12345-after-truncating-to-short/","title":"Why would int 53191 become -12345 after truncating to short"},{"content":"You: here is a statement in csapp (provided by the image). How could the number of bigger data type with leading 1 equals to the original number? explain it a bit.\nChatGPT: This statement refers to the sign extension process in two\u0026rsquo;s-complement representation, which ensures that the value of a number remains the same when its bit-width is expanded.\nKey Idea of Two\u0026rsquo;s-Complement Sign Extension In two\u0026rsquo;s-complement notation, the most significant bit (MSB) is the sign bit:\n0 indicates a non-negative number. 1 indicates a negative number. When extending a two\u0026rsquo;s-complement number to a larger bit-width, the sign bit is replicated (copied) into the additional higher-order bits. This preserves the number\u0026rsquo;s original value because:\nFor positive numbers (MSB = 0), adding leading 0s does not change the magnitude. For negative numbers (MSB = 1), adding leading 1s preserves the negative value by maintaining the two\u0026rsquo;s-complement encoding. Why Does This Work? The key is in how two\u0026rsquo;s-complement numbers are interpreted:\n$$B2T_w(\\mathbf{x}) = -x_{w-1} \\cdot 2^{w-1} + \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2} x_i \\cdot 2^i$$\nHere:\n$x_{w-1}$ is the sign bit. $x_i$ are the other bits of the number. When sign-extending to a new width $w\u0026rsquo; \u0026gt; w$, the replicated bits do not alter the value because:\nFor positive numbers ($x_{w-1} = 0$), adding leading 0s contributes nothing to the sum. For negative numbers ($x_{w-1} = 1$), adding leading 1s adds a negative offset equivalent to what would be added if the value were represented at the original width $w$.

When expanded to 8 bits:\n$$1010 \\rightarrow 11111010$$\nThe leading 1s preserve the negative value in two\u0026rsquo;s-complement, keeping it as -6.\nThis process guarantees that the number\u0026rsquo;s value remains consistent regardless of its width.\n","date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/how-could-the-number-of-bigger-data-type-with-leading-1-equals-to-the-original-number/","title":"How could the number of bigger data type with leading 1 equals to the original number?"},{"content":"You:\nI\u0026rsquo;m learning csapp, please explain me why $T2U_{w}(-1) = UMax_{w}$.\nChatGPT:\nThe equation $T2U_w(-1) = UMax_w$ comes from the relationship between signed and unsigned integer representations in two\u0026rsquo;s complement arithmetic.\nHere’s why it holds:\nTwo\u0026rsquo;s Complement Representation:\nIn $w$-bit two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation, the signed integer $-1$ is represented as a bit pattern where all $w$ bits are $1$. For example, in 4 bits, $-1$ is $1111_2$. Interpreting the Bit Pattern as Unsigned:\nWhen interpreted as an unsigned number, the bit pattern $1111_2$ corresponds to the maximum unsigned value for $w$ bits, which is $2^w - 1$. This is because all $w$ bits contribute their maximum weight to the value. For example:\nIn 4 bits: $1111_2 = 2^4 - 1 = 15$. In 8 bits: $11111111_2 = 2^8 - 1 = 255$. Generalization:\nThe function $T2U_w(x)$ takes a signed integer $x$ and converts its two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation to an unsigned integer interpretation. For $x = -1$, the bit pattern is all $1$\u0026rsquo;s, so $T2U_w(-1) = UMax_w$, where $UMax_w = 2^w - 1$ is the maximum unsigned value for $w$ bits. Conclusion The equation $T2U_w(-1) = UMax_w$ reflects the dual interpretation of the same bit pattern under two\u0026rsquo;s complement (signed) and unsigned interpretations. The bit pattern for $-1$ in two\u0026rsquo;s complement is always the largest possible value in unsigned representation.\nYou:\nif -1 in two\u0026rsquo;s complement is represented by $1111_2$, how is the $TMin_2$ represented?\nChatGPT:\nIn two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation, the minimum signed value ($TMin_w$) for $w$-bit integers is represented by a bit pattern where the most significant bit (MSB) is $1$ and all other bits are $0$.\nFor $w = 2$, the minimum value ($TMin_2$) is represented as:\n$$10_2$$\nExplanation: Range of Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement Values:\nFor $w$-bit two\u0026rsquo;s complement, the range of values is: $$TMin_w = -2^{w-1} \\quad \\text{to} \\quad TMax_w = 2^{w-1} - 1$$ For $w = 2$, this range is: $$TMin_2 = -2^{2-1} = -2, \\quad TMax_2 = 2^{2-1} - 1 = 1$$ Bit Pattern for $TMin_2$:\nThe MSB in two\u0026rsquo;s complement indicates the sign of the number: $0$: Non-negative. $1$: Negative. $TMin_w$ is the most negative number, so its MSB is $1$, and all other bits are $0$. For $w = 2$, $TMin_2$ is: $$10_2$$ Verification:\nThe bit pattern $10_2$ represents: $$-2^{1} + 0 \\cdot 2^{0} = -2$$ This matches $TMin_2$. Summary: For $w = 2$, $TMin_2$ ($-2$) is represented by the bit pattern $10_2$.\nYou:\nIf the MSB is represent for a sign, how can it also be a counted number and involve in the calculation of its value?\nChatGPT:\nGreat question! This is a key insight into how two\u0026rsquo;s complement works—it combines the sign and value representation in a single system, allowing arithmetic operations to proceed uniformly without special handling for positive and negative numbers.\nHere’s how it works:\n1. The Role of the MSB in Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement In $w$-bit two\u0026rsquo;s complement representation:\nThe most significant bit (MSB) is indeed the sign bit: $0$: Non-negative. $1$: Negative. However, the MSB also contributes to the numerical value of the number. This is achieved by assigning the MSB a negative weight, making it part of the number\u0026rsquo;s representation. 2. Signed Value Calculation in Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement The value of a $w$-bit number in two\u0026rsquo;s complement is computed as:\n$$\\text{Value} = -2^{w-1} \\cdot \\text{MSB} + \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2} 2^i \\cdot \\text{bit}[i]$$\nThe MSB contributes $-2^{w-1}$ if it is $1$, which gives the number its negative weight. All other bits ($\\text{bit}[i]$) contribute their usual positive weights. 3. Example: 4-Bit Two\u0026rsquo;s Complement Let’s illustrate with $w = 4$:\nPositive Number ($0101_2$): $$\\text{MSB} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Value} = 0 \\cdot (-2^3) + 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5$$\nNegative Number ($1011_2$): $$\\text{MSB} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Value} = 1 \\cdot (-2^3) + 0 \\cdot 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = -8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = -5$$\nNotice how the MSB flips the numerical value into the negative range when it is $1$.\n4. Why This Works for Arithmetic By interpreting the MSB as $-2^{w-1}$, two\u0026rsquo;s complement ensures:\nArithmetic (addition and subtraction) can be performed without special handling for signed and unsigned numbers. Overflow detection and handling become consistent with bit manipulation rules. For instance:\nAdding $0101_2$ ($+5$) and $1011_2$ ($-5$) in two\u0026rsquo;s complement directly gives $0000_2$ ($0$). 5. Intuition The MSB’s dual role as both the sign and a weighted bit is the magic of two\u0026rsquo;s complement. It ensures that the entire binary number encodes both the magnitude and the sign seamlessly, allowing all bits—including the MSB—to be treated consistently in calculations.\n","date":"2024-11-21T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/why-does-a-twos-complement-encoded-1-convert-to-unsigned-encoding-would-be-the-max-value-of-unsiged-number-t2u_w-1-umax_w/","title":"why does a two's complement encoded -1 convert to unsigned encoding would be the max value of unsiged number?

However, there is a conflict in their rendering of images.\nHugo accesses all sources from its root, while obsidian vault gets images from its root too (which isn\u0026rsquo;t the same path as hugo\u0026rsquo;s root). This result in mismatched URLs in markdown files.\nFortunately, Hugo provides a mounting functionality that enable remapping paths within the project. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of my solution.\nFirst, I have a Hugo project called blog, with a directory structure like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 blog/ ├── static/ │ ├── favicon.ico │ └── css/ ├── content/ │ └── post/ │ ├── file.md │ └── ... ├── ... I use the content/post directory as my Obsidian vault. When I want to insert an image img.png (placed in content/post/_images) into file.md, I tried these URLs: ![alt image](_image/img.png) and ![alt image](img.png). Both rendered correctly in obsidian but failed in both local and remote Hugo sites for the reason mentioned above.\nTo solve this, we need to let Hugo know where we put the images. Add these configuration in your Hugo config file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;content/post/_images\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static/_images\u0026#39; Here is the explanation:\nThe first mount with same static source and target aims to prevent resources in default Hugo static directory from overwritten. The second mount maps content/post/_images to static/_images, allowing both Hugo site and Obsidian to resolve the _images path properly. Important notes:\nHugo will combine all configuration files into one, and place it in the project root. Therefore, paths in the Hugo config above should start from current directory without leading slash /. The static directory will be integrated and disappear, and image URLs in markdown files shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a leading / as it will be interpreted as your host root rather than Hugo project root. Here are the different test results showing how the presence of leading / in an image URLs affects remote and local Hugo sites:\nbaseurl img url remote local xxx.io/ /_images/img.png failed succeed xxx.io/ _images/img.png succeed succeed xxx.io/blog /_images/img.png failed failed xxx.io/blog _images/img.png succeed succeed Note: Only Obsidian can render images without the /_images prefix; both remote and local sites requires it.\nDetailed outcomes:\nbaseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local failed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png; local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png The key finding is that baseurl only affects the local site behavior.

Heap. Shared libraries. Stack. kernel virtual memory. 1.7.4 Files A file is a sequence of bytes. Every I/O devices is modeled as a file.

Every byte of memory is identified by a unique nubmer, known as address, and the set of all possible addresses is known as the virtual address space.\nVirtual address space is just a conceptual image presented to mechine-level program. The actual implementation uses a combination of DRAM, flash memory, disk storage,special hardware, and operating system software to provide the program with what apears to be a monolithic byte array.\nThe GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) can compile programs according to the conventions of several different version of the C language, based on different command-line options.\n2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation Decimal and binary values associated with the hexadecimal digits:\nFor $x = 2,048 = 2^{11}$, we have $n = 11 = 3 + 4 \\cdot 2$, giving hexdecimal representation 0x800.\n2.1.2 Data Sizes A 32-bit word size limits the virtual address space to 4 gigabytes(written 4 GB), that is, just over 4 x 10^9 bytes. Scaling up to a 64-bit word size leads to a virtual address space of 16 exabytes, or around 1.84 x 10^19 bytes.\nThe distinction referring to programs as being either \u0026ldquo;32-bit programs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;64-bit programs\u0026rdquo; lies in how a program is compiled, rather than the type of machine on which it runs.\nThe C language supports multiple data formats for both integer and floating-piont data.\nint32_t and int64_t have exactly 4 and 8 bytes, respectively, to avoid the vagaries of relying on \u0026ldquo;typical\u0026rdquo; sizes and different compiler settings.\n2.1.3 Addressing and Byte Ordering The convention where the least significant bytes comes first is referred to as little endian. The convention where the most sifnificant byte comes first is referred to as big endian.\nFor value x = 0x01234567, the high-order byte has hexadecimal value 0x01, while the low-order byte has value 0x67.\nAlthough the floating-pint and the integer data both encode the numeric value 12,345, they have very different byte patterns: 0x00003039 for the integer and 0x4640E400 for floating point. In general, these two formats use different encoding shemes. If we expand these hexadecimal patterns into binary form and shift them appropriately, we find a sequence of 13 matching bits, indicated by a sequence of asterisks, as follows:\n2.1.4 Representing Strings None\n2.1.5 Representing Code None\n2.1.6 Introduction to Boolean Algebra When we consider operations ^, \u0026amp; and ~ operating on bit vectors of length w, we get a different mathematical form, known as a Boolean ring.\na ^ a = 0 for any value a, so (a ^ b) ^ a = b.\nAccording to the position of 1 from right to left, bit vector a = [01101001] encodes the set A = {0, 3, 5, 6}, while bit vector b = [01010101] encodes the set B = {0, 2, 4, 6}. Then the operation a \u0026amp; b yields bit vector [01000001], while $A \\cap B$ = {0, 6}.\n2.1.7 Bit-Level Operations in C The best way to determin the effect of a bit-level expression is to extend the hexadecimal arguments to their binary representations, perform the operations in binary, and then convert back to the hexadecimal.\nA mask is a bit pattern that indicates a selected set of bits within a word. The expression ~0 will yield a mask of all ones.\n2.1.8 Logical Operations in C A bitwise operation will have behavior matching that of its logical counterpart only in the special case in which the arguments are restricted to 0 or 1.\nThe logical operators do not evaluate their second argument if the result of the expression can be determined by evaluating the first argument.\n2.1.9 Shift Operations in C Left shift x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; k: $x$ is shifted $k$ bits to the left, dropping off the $k$ most significant bits and filling the right end with $k$ zeros.\nRight shift x \u0026gt;\u0026gt; k has:\nLogical. A logical right shift fills the left end with $k$ zeros. Arithmetic. An arithemetic right shift fills the left end with $k$ repetitions of the most significant bit. For signed data (int, long, etc.), it determined by compiler (according to mechine structure) whether right shift in c is logical or arithmetic.\nWhile for unsigned data (unsigned int, unsigned long), it is always logical right shift.\nHere are examples: Arithmetic right shift is the most-used right shift for signed data. But for unsigned data it must be logical right shift.\nOn many machines, the shift instruction consider only the lower $log_2 w$ bits of the shift amount when shifting a w-bit value, and so the shift amount is computed as k mod w. w is the bit length of the data type. For instance:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 int x = 1; int w = 32; // 32-bit integer // These will give identical results: x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 3 // shift by 3 x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 35 // shift by 35 (35 mod 32 = 3) x \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 67 // shift by 67 (67 mod 32 = 3) // Because: 3 in binary = 00011 (lowest 5 bits) 35 in binary = 100011 (lowest 5 bits = 00011) 67 in binary = 1000011 (lowest 5 bits = 00011) 2.2 Integer Representations 2.2.1 Integral Data Types 2.2.2 Unsigned Encodings principle: Definition of unsigned encoding\nFor vector $\\vec{x} = [x_{w-1}, x_{w-2}, \\ldots, x_{0}$: $$ B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{w-1}x_{i}2^i \\qquad (2.1) $$\nThe least value is given by bit vector $[00 \\cdots 0]$ having integer value 0, and the greatest value is given by bit vector $[11 \\cdots 1]$ having integer value $UMax_{w} \\doteq \\sum_{i=0}^{w-1}2^i = 2^w - 1$.\nprinciple: Uniqueness of unsigned encoding\nFunction $B2U_{w}$ is a bijection.\n2.2.3 Two’s-Complement Encodings principle: Definition of two’s-complement encoding\nFor vector $\\vec{x} = [x_{w-1},x_{w-2},\\cdots x_{0}]$: $$ B2T_{w}(\\vec{x}) \\doteq -x_{w-1}2^{w-1} + \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2}x_{i}2^{i} \\qquad (2.3) $$\nThe MSB (most significant bit) has its dual role as both the sign and a weighted bit.\nThe least representable value is given by bitvector [10 ... 0] (set the bit with negative weight but clear all others),having integer value $TMin_{w} \\doteq - 2^{w-1}$.The greatest value is given by bitvector [01 ... 1] (clear the bit with negative weight but set all others),having integer value $Tmax_{w} \\doteq \\sum_{i=0}^{w-2}2^i = 2^{w} - 1$.\nprinciple: Uniqueness of two’s-complement encoding\nFunction $B2T_{w}$ is a bijection.\n$\\left| TMin \\right| = \\left| TMax \\right| + 1$\nSince 0 is nonnegative, this means that it can represent one less positive number than negative.\nTwo other standard representations for signed numbers: $$ B2O_{w}(\\vec{x}) \\doteq -x_{w-1}(2^{w-1} - 1) + \\sum {i=0}^{w-2}x{i}2^{i} $$ $$ B2S_{w}(\\vec{x}) \\doteq (-1)^{x_{w-1}} \\cdot \\left( \\sum {i = 0}^{w-2}x{i}2^{i} \\right) $$\n2.2.4 Conversions between Signed and Unsigned $$ T2U_{w}\\left( \\vec{x} \\right) \\doteq B2U_{w}\\left( T2B_{w} \\right) $$ $$ U2T_{w}\\left( \\vec{x} \\right) \\doteq B2T_{w}\\left( U2B_{w} \\right) $$\nprinciple: Conversion from two’s complement to unsigned\nFor x such that $TMinw ≤ x ≤ TMaxw$: $$ T2U_{w}\\left( x \\right) = \\begin{cases} x + 2^{w}, \u0026amp; x \u0026lt; 0 \\ x, \u0026amp; x \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\qquad (2.5) $$\nderivation: Conversion from two’s complement to unsigned\nComparing Equations 2.1 and 2.3, we can see that for bit pattern $\\vec{x}$, if we compute the difference $B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) - B2T_{w}(\\vec{x})$, the weighted sums for bits from 0 to w - 2 will cancel each other, leaving a value $B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) - B2T_{w}(\\vec{x}) = x_{w-1} (2^{w-1} - -2^{w-1}) = x_{w-1}2^{w}$. This gives a relationship $B2U_{w}(\\vec{x}) = B2T_{w}(\\vec{x}) + x_{w-1}2^{w}$. We therefore have $$ B2U_{w}(T2B_{w}(x)) = T2U_{w}(x) = x ;+;x_{w-1}2^{w} \\qquad (2.6) $$\nFor the two’s-complement case, the most significant bit serves as the sign bit, which we diagram as a leftward-pointing gray bar. For the unsigned case, this bit has positive weight, which we show as a rightward-pointing black bar.\nprinciple: Unsigned to two’s-complement conversion For u such that $0 \\leq u \\leq UMax_{w}$: $$ U2T_{w}(u) = \\begin{cases} u, \u0026amp; u \\leq TMax_{w} \\ u - 2^{w}, \u0026amp; u \u0026gt; Tmax_{w} \\end{cases} \\qquad (2.7) $$\nderivation: Unsigned to two’s-complement conversion Let $\\vec{u} = U2B_{w}(u)$. This bit vector will also be the two’s-complement representation of $U2T_{w}(u)$. Equations 2.1 and 2.3 can be combined to give $$ U2T_{w}(u) = -u_{w-1}2^{w} + u \\qquad (2.8) $$\nTo summarize, we considered the effects of converting in both directions between unsigned and two’s-complement representations. For values x in the range $0 \\leq x \\leq TMax_{w}$, we have $T2U_{w}(x) = x$ and $U2T_{w}(x) = x$. That is, numbers in this range have identical unsigned and two’s-complement representations. For values outside of this range, the conversions either add or subtract $2^{w}$. For example, we have $T2U_{w}(-1) = -1 + 2^{w}$ -the negative number closest to zero maps to the largest unsigned number. At the other extreme, one can see that $T2U_{w}(TMin_{w}) = -2^{w-1} + 2^{w} = 2^{w-1} = TMax_{w} - 1$ —the most negative number maps to an unsigned number just outside the range of positive two’s-complement numbers. Using the example of Figure 2.15, we can see that $T2U_{16}(-12345) = 65536 + -12345 = 53191$.\n2.2.5 Signed versus Unsigned in C From here on, since repeatedly taking screenshots and copying key words is very troublesome, I will only record key words that help with memory as summarized by myself, which also serves as an index.\nmost signed by default, suffix u for unsigned\n%d, %u, and %x a signed decimal, an unsigned decimal, and in hexadecimal format\npossible, print, int with %u, unsigned with %d\nresult of the expression -1 \u0026lt; 0U is 0 and unsigned, since 0U is unsigned, -1 is implicitly cast to unsigned, which is $T2U_{w}(-1) = UMax_{w} = 4294967295U$.\n2.2.6 Expanding the Bit Representation of a Number unsigned -\u0026gt; large data type =\u0026gt; add leading zeros\ntwo\u0026rsquo;s-complement -\u0026gt; large data type =\u0026gt; sign extension (filled by the first bit)\nThe key property we exploit is that $2^{w} - 2^{w-1} = 2^{w-1}$.
