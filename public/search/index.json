However, there is a conflict in their rendering of images.\nHugo accesses all sources from its root, while obsidian vault gets images from its root too (which isn\u0026rsquo;t the same path as hugo\u0026rsquo;s root). This result in mismatched URLs in markdown files.\nFortunately, Hugo provides a mounting functionality that enable remapping paths within the project. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of my solution.\nFirst, I have a Hugo project called blog, with a directory structure like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 blog/ ├── static/ │ ├── favicon.ico │ └── css/ ├── content/ │ └── post/ │ ├── file.md │ └── ... ├── ... I use the content/post directory as my Obsidian vault. When I want to insert an image img.png (placed in content/post/_images) into file.md, I tried these URLs: ![alt image](_image/img.png) and ![alt image](img.png). Both rendered correctly in obsidian but failed in both local and remote Hugo sites for the reason mentioned above.\nTo solve this, we need to let Hugo know where we put the images. Add these configuration in your Hugo config file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; [[module.mounts]] source = \u0026#39;content/post/_images\u0026#39; target = \u0026#39;static/_images\u0026#39; Here is the explanation:\nThe first mount with same static source and target aims to prevent resources in default Hugo static directory from overwritten. The second mount maps content/post/_images to static/_images, allowing both Hugo site and Obsidian to resolve the _images path properly. Important notes:\nHugo will combine all configuration files into one, and place it in the project root. Therefore, paths in the Hugo config above should start from current directory without leading slash /. The static directory will be integrated and disappear, and image URLs in markdown files shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a leading / as it will be interpreted as your host root rather than Hugo project root. Here are the different test results showing how the presence of leading / in an image URLs affects remote and local Hugo sites:\nbaseurl img url remote local xxx.io/ /_images/img.png failed succeed xxx.io/ _images/img.png succeed succeed xxx.io/blog /_images/img.png failed failed xxx.io/blog _images/img.png succeed succeed Note: Only Obsidian can render images without the /_images prefix; both remote and local sites requires it.\nDetailed outcomes:\nbaseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = /_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote failed, src = https://old-y.github.io/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png local failed, src = http://localhost:1313/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png baseurl = \u0026ldquo;https://old-y.github.io/blog\", url = _images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png, remote succeed, src = https://old-y.github.io/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png; local succeed, src = http://localhost:1313/blog/_images/figure%201.3%20compliation%20system.png The key finding is that baseurl only affects the local site behavior. With leading slash /, no matter how I change the baseurl in config file, the remote site will interpreted it into xxx/_images rather than xxx/blog/_images, but the local site will change accordingly.\n","date":"2024-11-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/resolving-image-insert-conflict-of-hugo-and-obsidian/","title":"Resolving image insert conflict of Hugo and Obsidian"},{"content":"If you want to upgrade neovim to the latest version in Linux/WSL, here is the steps:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # remove the current version sudo apt remove neovim # add neovim ppa sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable sudo apt update sudo apt install neovim # verify neovim installation nvim --version If you encounter an error \u0026ldquo;sudo: add-apt-repository: command not found\u0026rdquo;, then you should install the software-properties-common package.\n1 2 sudo apt update sudo apt install software-properties-common ","date":"2024-11-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/upgrade-neovim-to-the-latest/","title":"Upgrade Neovim To The Latest"},{"content":"\n1.1 Information Is Bits + Context All information in a system is represented as a bunch of bits.\n1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms The gcc compiler driver reads the source file hello.c and translated into an execuable object file hello.

It achieves both goal via the foundamental abstractions: processes, virtual memory, and files.\n1.7.1 Processes When the operating system decides to transfer control from the current process to some new process, it performs a context switch by saving the context of the current process, restoring the context of the new process, and then passing control to the new process.\n1.7.2 Threads Each thread runs in the context of the process and sharing the same code and global data.\n1.7.3 Virtual Memory Each process has the same uniform view of memory, which is known as its virtual address space.\nThe virtual address space seen by each process consists of a number of well defined areas, starting from low to high:\nProgram code and data. Heap. Shared libraries. Stack. kernel virtual memory. 1.7.4 Files A file is a sequence of bytes. Every I/O devices is modeled as a file. All input and output in the system is performed by reading and writing files, using a small set of system calls known as Unix I/O.\n1.8 Systems Communicate with Other Systems Using Networks The network can be viewed as just another I/O devices.\nThe system copies a sequence of bytes from main memory to the network adapter rather than disk controller, which helps the data flow across the network to another mechine instead of a local disk drive.\n","date":"2024-11-04T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/csapp-reading-notes-chapter-1/","title":"CSAPP reading notes - chapter 1"},{"content":"Linux First run the command in the terminal: curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\nThis command get and execute a shell script from the certain website, which downloads the necessary tools and environments.\nHere is the explanation of the flag of curl:\n-s, shows no output. -S, BUT error message. -f, silent failure on HTTP errors, which means only return an error code instead of the whole messages. then use the command below to source the environment: . ~/.cargo/env\n","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/cargo-installation/","title":"cargo installation"},{"content":"Linux go1.23.2 for instance:\n1 2 wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.23.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz rm -rf /usr/local/go \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.23.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz then add\n1 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin to the profile and run the source ~/.zshrc command.\n","date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/go-installation/","title":"go installation"},{"content":"Tutorial link: LazyVim for Ambitious Developers\nIn keybindings, C means Ctrl.\nChapter 1.

List all the main events in the format of character + event + time (if exist) + place (if exist) and by the order when it appeared in the text, for example: 1 2 - Steve had gone to the farm lastnight. - Isbel went looking for her son right after he disappeared. Summarize this chapter with a paragraph within 3 to 4 sentences. But remember that this is a 2nd-stage task and you should execute it only after I said \u0026ldquo;continue\u0026rdquo;. Note:\nIn task 1, if one is related to multiple person, you should point out in one introduction. In task 2, summarize each key event without omission or repetition. Task 1 and 2 should be placed in the same reply, and task 3 another. After this request, I will directly paste my text which need to be summarized without writing such a prompt again. You may assume that it is the same part as last. The content of current chapter is as follows: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nPolish text I\u0026rsquo;ve written an article to record the solution in English, please help me polish the text to fix it grammar as well as making it more native and fluent without changing its original meanings.\n","date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/p/useful-prompt/","title":"useful prompt"}]
